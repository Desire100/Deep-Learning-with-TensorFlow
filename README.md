# Deep-Learning-with-TensorFlow
this repo contains the knowlegde of how to use tensorflow framework to perform the latest techniques in the deep learning ecosystem.

Before we dive in tensorflow, we will manually build out a neural network that mimics the TensorFlow API. which greatly help in understanding when working with the real TensorFlow!
